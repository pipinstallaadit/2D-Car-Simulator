# ðŸŒ„ Terrain Generation Mini Project

This mini project demonstrates a simple terrain generation technique using Perlin noise in a 2D canvas. The generated terrain features a dynamic landscape that evolves over time, creating a visually appealing and natural-looking environment.

## ðŸŽ¨ Project Overview

The project uses the p5.js library to create a canvas where the terrain is drawn based on Perlin noise. The terrain includes a sky and ground, providing a basic visual context for the generated landscape.
