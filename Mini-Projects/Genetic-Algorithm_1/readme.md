# ðŸ§¬ Genetic Algorithm Phrase Evolution Mini Project

This mini project showcases the application of genetic algorithms to evolve a specific phrase over generations. The project attempts to generate the target phrase "To be or not to be" using a population of randomly generated characters, applying selection, crossover, and mutation.

## ðŸŽ¨ Project Overview

The project uses the p5.js library to visualize the evolution of phrases on a canvas. Each generation of phrases is evaluated for fitness based on how closely they match the target phrase. The best phrases are selected for reproduction, gradually evolving towards the target phrase.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Evolving Phrases**: The algorithm evolves phrases over generations to match the target phrase.
- **Dynamic Visualization**: Real-time updates of the best phrase generated in each generation.
- **Genetic Algorithm Mechanics**: Implements selection, crossover, and mutation processes for phrase evolution.
