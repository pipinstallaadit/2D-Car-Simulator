# ðŸš— Car Physics Simulation Mini Project

This mini project demonstrates a simple car physics simulation using the Planck.js library. The simulation showcases a car that can move left and right on a flat surface, demonstrating basic physics principles like collision and motion.

## ðŸŽ¨ Project Overview

The project uses the Planck.js library to create a physics-based simulation of a car with wheels. Users can control the car's movement using the left and right arrow keys, allowing for interactive testing of physics behaviors.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Dynamic Car Simulation**: The car reacts to physics, demonstrating realistic movement and collision behavior.
- **Interactive Control**: Use keyboard controls to move the car left and right.
- **Visual Representation**: The simulation visually represents the car and its wheels, providing an understanding of its mechanics.
